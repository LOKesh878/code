Problem Statement
Generate a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loops. The sequence is generated as follows.
If A[i] is greater than 0, A[i+1] = A[i] - 5, and continue this operation until A[i] becomes less than or equal to 0. and then, A[i+1] = A[i] + 5, and continue this operation until A[i] becomes equal to N.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer N.

Constraints:-
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
Output
Print the pattern.
Example
Sample Input 1:
16

Sample Output 1:
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16

Explanation 1:
We basically first reduce 5 one by one until we reach a negative or 0. After we reach 0 or negative, we one by one add 5 until we reach N.
